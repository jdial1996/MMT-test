# Cloud Systems Engineer - Technical Test
Thank you for your interest in applying for the Cloud Systems Engineering role and well done on making it so far! This repo is a collection of challenges which you will have to attempt to resolve.

### Submitting Results
Each section has an explanation of how to submit your code. It would also be benefitial to let us know either via a `RESULT_FILES.md` file on the repo OR emailing us the names of the files you produce. This will make it easier for us to assess your application.

### What are we looking for?

- Either **one** of the two tests which have been given to you in this repo
- Code which has been linted & tested using a linter/validator of your choice
- Infrastructure as Code templates written in `yaml` for CloudFormation or `hcl` where there is Terraform.
- Well documented code with comments where necessary
- Cite any references (copy/paste) of code which is used in your implementation. This will make the assessment process easier. (P.S: You will not be marked down for this where relevant references are used as long as you can justify the use when asked.)
- You can attempt both the tests and/or do a little bit of both depending on your level of experience, We will assess the responses accordingly.

### I am only able to complete certain parts of the test, what to do?
No problem. We have a three phased test. You can choose to submit your application with whatever you have completed, if you feel that you are unable to complete the entire test in time. You will be marked based on what has been submitted (Something is better than nothing!).
